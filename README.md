Ivy Wallet is a free budget manager and spending tracker app that‚Äôll help you manage your personal finances with ease.

Imagine Ivy Wallet as a digital financial notebook (manual expense tracker) in which you‚Äôll track your income, expenses, and budget.

You'll get an answer to these three essential questions:

1) Exactly how much money do I have right now in all accounts combined? _(money manager)_

2) How much did I spend this month and where? _(expense tracker)_

3) How much money can I spend and still reach my financial goals? _(budget manager)_

## Ideology :earth_africa:

We believe that people _(not corporations or business entities)_ can create innovative, open-source,
and free software that can make the world a better place.

**We want Ivy to be:**

- A place where you can excel and have fun while contributing to something meaningful.
- A community where you can express yourself freely and build the future that you want to live in.
- An open-source project with zero-tolerance to "bad" code and putting code quality first. 

**We believe in:**

- Freedom.
- Creativity & Innovation.
- Challenging the status quo.
- Technical excellence and **eliminating complexity at any cost**.
- Decentralization.
- Having the right to do what you believe in, not what you're told to.

## Architecture

Our goal is to make this repo the **go-to project to learn about Android Development best practices** and experience deligthful software architecture and design.

We're far from this and we live in an every changing dynamic world => our software design will change a lot! :rocket:

But fear not, we'll document major design change as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in **[docs/architecture](docs/architecture/)**.

> The best things of ADRs that you'll also be able to see our wrong decisions and how we fixed them!

We're also linking great learning materials (books, videos, articles, papers) in **[docs/resources](docs/resources/)**.

> Have ideas how we can make our code better? [![PRs welcome!](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/ILIYANGERMANOV/ivy-wallet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
