# ADR#9: Flows Performance üëÄ

Ivy Wallet loads data turbo slow when there are many transactions. See [Issue#1719](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/issues/1719)... üê¢

## Context

- After importing ~Nk transactions, the "Home" and "Account" tabs in the Main screen started to load extremly slow...
- **Note:** the same data loads instantly in the old Ivy Wallet (`prod` branch) on the PlayStore.

## Problems

- Ivy Wallet consumes ~220MB RAM for just showing the "Home" tab which is bad!
- After filling the available the GC starts collecting lize crazy with the one only result of setting the CPU on fire... Getting exponentially slower:
